The project focuses on **fraud detection using machine learning**, leveraging **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning. The data preprocessing phase includes cleaning duplicates, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Feature engineering involves creating fraud-specific indicators, such as balance differences and fraud flags, while applying log transformations to manage data skewness. To address multi-collinearity, **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** analysis is used to remove highly correlated features. A **Random Forest Classifier** is chosen for its robustness and scalability, with **RandomizedSearchCV** optimizing key hyperparameters like tree depth and split criteria. Model evaluation is conducted using a **Confusion Matrix, AUC-ROC Score, and Classification Report** to assess fraud detection accuracy. Additionally, **SHAP values and Feature Importance Analysis** provide interpretability, helping understand how the model identifies fraudulent transactions. This approach ensures an efficient, explainable, and well-optimized fraud detection system.
